# Motor regulation with a potentiometer
The program was created in laboratory classes. The goal of the assignment was to write a program that allows you to smoothly change the speed of a DC motor in the range (0...100%) using a potentiometer.

# Task Description:
Write a program to smoothly change the speed of a DC motor in the range (0...100%) using a potentiometer. Use a T1 counter and an A/D converter in the program. 
In SimulIDE simulator, connect an LED (light dimmer) in parallel to the motor. Then add a keyboard control function: 
S1 key - turns on the motor and light, 
S2 key - turns off the motor and light.
At the very end, add so that it is possible to adjust the speed of the motor and the intensity of the light in a stepwise manner, using 3 keys: 
S1 - ON/OFF,
S2â€“UP, 
S3-DOWN.
